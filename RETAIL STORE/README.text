# Sales Prediction Report

## Introduction

In this project, we aimed to predict weekly sales for a retail store using data-driven approaches and machine learning algorithms. Accurate sales prediction is crucial for improving various aspects of the retail business, such as inventory management, marketing strategies, and overall performance.

## Data

We utilized a dataset containing historical sales data along with relevant features:

- Store: Store identifier.
- Date: Date of the recorded sales data.
- Weekly_Sales: The target variable, representing the weekly sales in dollars.
- Holiday_Flag: A binary flag indicating whether a holiday week (1) or a non-holiday week (0).
- Temperature: The average temperature during the week.
- Fuel_Price: The fuel price during the week.
- CPI (Consumer Price Index): An indicator of inflation or deflation.
- Unemployment: The unemployment rate during the week.

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing

- Data cleaning and handling missing values.
- Feature engineering to create relevant features such as lagged sales and seasonality.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Analyzed data distribution, correlations, and trends.
- Identified insights that guided our modeling approach.

### Model Selection

1. **Linear Regression**
   - Chosen as a simple baseline model.
   - Limited performance due to linear assumptions.

2. **Random Forest**
   - Employed for better capturing complex relationships in the data.
   - Achieved superior predictive performance.

### Model Evaluation

- Split data into training and testing sets.
- Calculated accuracy metrics including MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R-squared for both models.
- Visualized actual vs. predicted sales.

## Results

### Linear Regression

- MAE: 430,774.13
- MSE: 297,831,458,609.28
- RMSE: 545,397.69
- R-squared (R2) Score: 0.02

### Random Forest

- MAE: 285,842.65
- MSE: 172,342,434,703.17
- RMSE: 415,080.72
- R-squared (R2) Score: 0.53

## Conclusion

- The Random Forest model significantly outperformed the Linear Regression model in sales prediction accuracy.
- The R2 score of 0.53 for the Random Forest model suggests that it explains approximately 53% of the variance in sales.
- Further model refinement and feature engineering could potentially enhance predictive performance.

## Next Steps

- Continuously monitor and maintain the model's performance.
- Consider hyperparameter tuning and additional feature engineering.
- Implement the model in a production environment for real-time or batch sales forecasting.
